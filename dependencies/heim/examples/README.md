# Examples of how to use `heim`

All examples can be executed with

```
cargo run --example $name
```

Note that these examples are using `tokio` async runtime,
but you can also use `async-std`, any other async runtime,
or even the usual blocking way to do things.\
More details on different async runtimes support can be found in
[user guide](https://heim-rs.github.io/book/async/runtimes/index.html).
